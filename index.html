One of the classes that I originially took just because I needed to complete the course, IB Sports Science, has now become one of the most interesting classes purely due to experiential learning. The class holds so much breadth, covering everything from the biology to psychology of sports, though I feel through experiential learning I&rsquo;m able to develop depth on each individual subject, reading up on articles on specific areas that I&rsquo;m interested in my own time. Experiential learning has been my way of expressing myself, of expressing my skepticism about concepts and proving them right or wrong in a way that feels right at home.</p><a href=#1-climbing-in-league-of-legends><h2 id=1-climbing-in-league-of-legends><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1.

<em>Picture of me training clicks in loldodgegame in preparation for the daily 3 block</em></p><a href=#investigation><h3 id=investigation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Investigation</h3></a><p>Initially, League of Legends was just a game that my sister played when she was in high school that I found to be interesting. I treated it like any other game, a way to relax or have fun after a tough school day.</p><p>While in senior year, I wasn&rsquo;t active in some of the more traditional school sports for this senior year, though I began finding that many of the concepts I learned in my IB Sports Science class couuld be applied to my League grind as well.</p><p>Upon closer inspection I began to realize that the game was much deeper and representative of life than I had previously thought: it&rsquo;s like any other sport: there exists athletes, a mindset that the athlete might have, coaches, and a competitive environment.</p><a href=#goal><h4 id=goal><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Goal</h4></a><p>My number one purpose in this CAS activity was to improve at the game, though many things can be improved. An outcome goal could be reaching an overall higher rank in the game (as the game does have a ranking system), but having a calm mindset and daily routine was also important for me. I initially set a process goal of playing three games every day, not going over or under that limit, and always reflecting upon each and every game that I played. I realized that investigations can come from what you&rsquo;ve always loved or enjoyed, but want to gain a deeper insight on.</p><a href=#preparation><h3 id=preparation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Preparation</h3></a><p>I had already the technological hardware to play the game, as I had throughout my life, but because I hadn&rsquo;t been taking the game very seriously for the past few months, I could feel that my mechanical skill was not as good as it used to be.</p><p>I needed to train up my motor skills to help accomplish this task, but was isolated from the games itself. My two friends in this case were the practice tool and loldodgegame online.</p><p>To reflect over things, I used my notebook, with paper and pen, something I had never used in the past before, to craft theories. Finally, to learn new content, I would observe other players in game and in online videos, as well as</p><a href=#action><h3 id=action><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Action</h3></a><p>One thing that I remember had kept me off of the game for a long time was choosing which champions to play. Like track and field, there was so much pomp and circumstance surrounding getting into the game. Time had to be spent selecting champions, choosing champs, and more. Part of the reason why I quit playing was because</p><p>League is a 5v5 game, and I was only one player in the game. 9 other players are chosen completely at random. Oftentimes when playing, I&rsquo;d see my teammates losing and internally blame them. In the past, I would often put blame on my teammates. But from what I learned in IB sports science as well as some coaching videos on the game, I realized that how skilled players were were something <em>outside my locus of control</em>. The only things I could control was how well I played myself. In my replays of the game, I stopped watching how well my teammates played and lamented on their own playstyle. I feel like this is one of the single most important lessons I learned from this experience.</p><p>One thing that I noticed in my games were that certain games (such as promotional ones, which would determine whether I moved up or down in rank) I would often quiver uncontrollably in excitement, because a win or loss would hold more impact on my rank than usual. The two things that helped me here were thinking about the fact that the games I played were opportunities for improvement, focusing less on the outcome and more on my own performance. I also used techniques from IB Sports Science to calm myself. Progressive muscle relaxation, which involves tensing and relaxing each muscle of the body helped me make my muscles less jittery as I went into games.</p><a href=#celebration><h3 id=celebration><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Celebration</h3></a><p>As of may 23, 2022, I&rsquo;ve climbed to and am hovering around diamond 2 in rank. Even though this isn&rsquo;t the highest rank that I&rsquo;ve climbed to in the past, I&rsquo;m still glad of the change in mindset that I&rsquo;ve had. A positive mindset makes it so much more enjoyable to play the game, and because of what I&rsquo;ve learned and applied from sports science, I go into a game much more calmly.</p><a href=#final-reflection><h3 id=final-reflection><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Final Reflection</h3></a><p>This activity made me realize that League, like physical games, contain so many aspects of what we think of as &ldquo;sports&rdquo;. One can treat it as a way to relax, one can dedicate themselves to improving, or one can watch along and cheer on their favorite professional athlete. The lessons I&rsquo;ve learned have helped me deal with failure in other areas of life in a much more positive light. For example, I got a low grade on one of my spanish projects. But instead of lamenting the fact that my teacher grades strictly, or the fact that I also had other projects that took my time, I looked instead at what I could control: the conjugations of the verbs, the phrases and expressions, the mastery of the language itself, and forgave my performance.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not to say however, that my climb in League has always been sunshine and rainbows. On weekends or days without homework, the limit of two to three games that I set for myself often would stretch into a higher number of games, and I questioned whether or not the game bordered on addiction territory. There&rsquo;s so much that I learned from this activity, but it also costed tons of time. A higher rank also made it more difficult to play with my friends: whereas before there was opportunity to play together in ranked, a higher rank makes it impossible.</p><a href=#2-learning-japanese><h2 id=2-learning-japanese><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2.

<em>Picture of my notebook, in the learning of the song 僕が死のうと思ったのは</em></p><a href=#investigation-1><h3 id=investigation-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Investigation</h3></a><ul><li>There&rsquo;s actually a ton of reasons why I wanted to learn Japanese</li><li>Light novel</li><li>Manga</li><li>Songs</li></ul><p>Near the end of junior year, I had begun picking up and reading manga as a personal hobby as something to do during quarantine. During that year, I had found a great series called Konosuba that I really enjoyed. The official english translation ended two or three volumes behind the japanese one, so I wanted to learn Japanese so that I could read Konosuba. I had also found an interest in reading manga (Japanese comic books), however, many series that had fan translations were very badly translated, with some groups using google translate to do their translations. I figured if the translations were barely legible english, it&rsquo;d be worth it to try to learn japanese myself. During quarantine, with the long time spent doing homework and in front of the computer, I began to enjoy listening to music as a remedy for monotony. An artist and a band that I really enjoyed were Aimer and Yorushika (ヨルシカ). The melodies and chords in their songs were incredibly captivating, and because I listened to many of their songs on repeat, I wondered if I would be able to understand them well should I be able to learn Japanese.</p><a href=#goal-1><h4 id=goal-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Goal</h4></a><p>My goal for this activity was to better understand the Japanese language. I really wanted to be able to read a light novel, but I knew that for a book that was well above grade level, in a language that I had no experience in (except for some of the kanji characters, which carried over from Chinese), that was a bit ambitious. I wanted to learn from manga, but that was also difficult because text couldn&rsquo;t be easily copied from manga (and thus look up).</p><a href=#preparation-1><h3 id=preparation-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Preparation</h3></a><p>Preparation for this activity was quite frankly, simple and straightforward at the very beginning, then descended to utter hell.</p><p>At first I was considering going straight into the lyrics and trying to understand a song that way, since I did know the chinese characters, however after taking one look at the japanese lyrics for sukidakara (好きだから) by Yuika, I realized that it was going to be very hard to do, perhaps even impossible. There were specific uniquely japanese characters like katakana and hiragana as well as kanji that I didn&rsquo;t understand at the time. Much less the structure of the lexicon, I also had no idea how grammar in the language worked.</p><p>For learning languages, there exist an innumerable number of tutorials and guides and regimens. I picked an article by Tofugu to start learning the very basics of the language, but as I&rsquo;ll discuss later, going back to the drawing board and rethinking of a plan to learn the language was one of the biggest temptations that I struggled with through learning the language.</p><a href=#action-1><h3 id=action-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Action</h3></a><p>Learning the initial alphabet of the language, hiragana and katakana were the very easiest steps. I realized the importance of mneumonics in memorizing information, and by the end of a few hours of dedication and practice, I could reasonably recognize and sound out all the basic characters. The problem was what came next.</p><p>I needed some way to understand the grammar of the language, aside from the basic characters. I decided to pick up a textbook. But
<a href=https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/grammar/taekim.htm rel=noopener>Tae Kim</a>l, the de facto textbook that online forums recommendeded was hundreds of pages long. I was prepared to go through with reading it, but after a few days, it became a huge drag for me to read through it. The author used kanji that I wasn&rsquo;t famililar with in example sentences, and for every single concept there were dozens of rules and exceptions.</p><p>So I tried another textbook, called
<a href=https://sakubi.neocities.org/ rel=noopener>Sakubi</a>. This one recommended the learner to ignore the things that they didn&rsquo;t understand. And so I read through all 50 chapters of the textbook in the span of a week. Every word I read into my head, but at face value I understood maybe 15% of the text. It was a weird feeling&mldr; usually if something is right outside of my comfort zone, it&rsquo;d still feel like a difficult thing to due, and would strain my brain. Like learning a concept in math for example. But reading the 50 chapters in such a flurry and glossing over things I didn&rsquo;t understand felt so absurd that I developed kind of a numbness to it. I began to feel jaded about learning the language, and by the latter chapters I was just hoping to finish the textbook.</p><p>Then I tried to read through a single chapter in a manga. I understood 10% of the words (mostly from the fact that I knew Chinese) and maybe 1% of the grammar. Looking back, although I had a lot of time that summer, that drive easily led me to burnout, and I almost considered quitting learning the language. It really made me feel depressed. Learning a language wasn&rsquo;t like doing homework: I couldn&rsquo;t tell myself that I&rsquo;d finish the homework today and forget it tomorrow: I realized that learning a language was something that took daily effort and discipline: the discipline to challenge yourself but also pace yourself to tackle things only just above your level. There&rsquo;s also no such thing as procrastination, and doing homework at the last minute. If I procrastinated on Japanese, I would just never learn the language. My theory, conjecture really, is that language is sort of like learning math. Before one learns calculus they need to know algebra, and before algebra the basic operations of adding, subtracting, and so on.</p><p>Things got better over time though. I found a youtuber named
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdmU8hGK4Fg3LghTVtKltQ rel=noopener>Cure Dolly</a> who explained Japanese in a much more logical way.</p><p>Learning the language through songs was also very fun. The lyrics are shorter in length than something like manga or a book, so I&rsquo;m able to read it without over stressing it, if that makes sense. There&rsquo;s some sentences I get, some sentences that I don&rsquo;t get, but songs I never get unless I try and memorize them. There&rsquo;s that beautiful moment when something unintuitive becomes intuitive. And repeating the same verse of a song over and over again in my head allowed me to understand some sentences.</p><a href=#celebration-1><h3 id=celebration-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Celebration</h3></a><p>I&rsquo;m still unable to understand most of manga, books, or anime that I watch. However, I have learned a song and a half and expanded my vocabulary, and my understanding of the grammar is much better than it used to be.</p><a href=#final-reflection-1><h3 id=final-reflection-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Final Reflection</h3></a><p>Learning Japanese was very hard, and it was a journey that I would have never thought I would&rsquo;ve tackled in the past. It made me realize the difference between pursuing a school subject and personal skill.</p><a href=#3-running><h2 id=3-running><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3.

This struck a chord with me, as focusing on work and not procrastinating was always a huge problem for me, especially through quarantine.

<a href=https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/running-and-aerobic-exercises/get-running-with-couch-to-5k/ rel=noopener>couch25k</a>&rdquo; program by NHK, a 9 week program that progressively increases the intensity of 30 minutes of running, from running on and off to running consistently for 30 minutes, in the form of a podcast.</p><a href=#action-2><h3 id=action-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Action</h3></a><p>I found a great sense of discovery when running. I would just take off in one direction of the neighborhood with the goal of making it back over the course of 30 minutes. So it was very fulfilling seeing myself make it farther and farther every day and every week.</p><p>Pacing myself by time rather than distance was also an unsolicited change that I couldn&rsquo;t have been more thankful for. In the past, when I attempted to get back into running, I would force myself to run an arbitrary number of miles or circuits around the neighborhood, which made it so that my motivation fluctuated randomly (e.g. sprinting up a hill then relapsing into a walk when I felt too tired), but going the same distance no matter how hard I ran.</p><p>However, the orator of the podcast&rsquo;s idea (a runner) was that I could go at any speed, as long as I was running. Instead of aiming for a fast mile time from the start, NHK said that it was important to stay calm and even slow down if needed. Thinking this way made progress a lot more concrete and satisfying, and prevented me from over straining myself, and reminded me of the lessons I learned while trying to learn Japanese: not taking everything on at once and accepting the current level that I was at at a certain time.</p><p>However, this period of running over the two months also seemingly felt the farthest from running that I&rsquo;d ever felt. Instead of running with my bare ears to the wind and only myself to think about, listening to a podcast with music made the whole experience feel weirdly numbing. If my motivation ever wavered, I could lean on music, and kind of zone out wihle I ran to ignore the fatigue. It honestly felt like I was cheating in a way, because Instead of asking myself if I could make it to the top of the next hill and asking myself about the motivation and reasons I had for running in the first place, I simply followed what the orator said in the podcast. It was like I was a machine, and life, a videogame. I felt like I was missing something.</p><a href=#celebration-2><h3 id=celebration-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Celebration</h3></a><p>At the end of the period of 2 months that I picked up running, I was able to go from barely being able to run for a few minutes to running 30 minutes consistently, up and down my steep neighborhood hills. The exercise that I got over the two months, surprisingly did help me concentrate on the huge tasks that I faced, such as completing my college applications and finishing my IAs.</p><a href=#final-reflection-2><h3 id=final-reflection-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Final Reflection</h3></a><p>Running made me realize that pacing, and restraining effort and intensity in a particular session is actually a vital part of self-discipline. What&rsquo;s much more important than one-off effort is consistency over a period of time. However, I also felt like I missed something by relinquishing control of my own training regimen to an external program, using music . Especially with the later workouts, in which the orator dictated when to speed up and slow down, I felt like there was something deeply wrong with doing that, though I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why.</p><a href=#4-coding-tetris><h2 id=4-coding-tetris><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>4.

Due to the block schedule in junior year, I felt like during the school year I wasn&rsquo;t able to pursue learning more about this programming language, however, in the beginning of summer I decided to take on a project that would help better familarize myself with the language.</p><a href=#goal-3><h4 id=goal-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Goal</h4></a><p>My goal was to create my own unique implementation of Tetris (a popular and well-known old game where the goal is to piece tetriminos together to fill a line). I&rsquo;d always wanted to make the game, but I was never sure how to do it.</p><a href=#preparation--action><h3 id=preparation--action><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Preparation & Action</h3></a><p>I&rsquo;d always felt like coding was something that required continuous learning and research, so I did minimal prepration going into the project, and learned along the way.</p><p>The first challenge was understanding the Rust language. Some of what I learned from my coding classes at school as well as what I knew about other languages applied to this language, but with any language, it had its unique quirks and philosophy.</p><p>I initially tried to go through the full
<a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ rel=noopener>programming book</a> written by the authors of the language. The first few chapters very much helped me understand the principles of the language, but the book was extremely long and some concepts I didn&rsquo;t understand at first glance and had to reread over the span of multiple days. By the time I had reached the last few chapters of the book, the content was getting very complex but I still found myself forgetting earlier concepts. I was, in effect, still nervous to actually write code in the language, because I had the belief that I didn&rsquo;t fully understand the language.</p><p>After a full week went by, I realized that I had done a lot of research on the book but hadn&rsquo;t started at all on coding the actual Tetris. I decided to start writing code instead. This turned out to be a huge boon for me. I was very suprised at how the process of writing code made it easier for me to understand the concepts from the book, and how I had become much more fluent over the span of a few days than just reading and not applying. Learning the fundamental concepts of the language helped me too, but ultimately, I learned that overcoming that discomfort and just writing and looking up errors as you went is an unavoidable part of the process of learning a language, or maybe even any skill.</p><p>I had an intuition on how to code the easy parts of Tetris, such as the grid and the pieces. However, one part of the code that always scared me was how to rotate the pieces, and dealing with logic that bumped pieces rotated outside the grid back into the grid, and so on. Looking back on it, I realized that this doubt was the reason that I had avoided trying to implement coding Tetris for the longest time. I knew that other people had coded Tetris before, so I knew the solution existed, but at the same time I wondered if I was letting my problem-solving skill down if I didn&rsquo;t try to practice it and try to implement it myself before looking for the solution. After hours, I finally decided to look at Wikipedia algorithms, some of which were hard-coded. This brought me relief, because hard-code means that I didn&rsquo;t miss a clever solution. However, the balance between using problem-solving and dumping massive amounts of time into trying to solve something by oneself or simply looking at the solution and remembering it for later is a question of philosophy that I still don&rsquo;t understand today. I feel like this feeling of guilt at looking at the solution is not a question of pride but rather fear of inadequate practice, that perhaps comes from the belief that many coding interviews require the interviewee to solve problems without the help of the internet. At the same time though, on the job one would have access to the internet. And seeing tons and tons of problems might provide insights to algorithms that could be applied to new problems as well.</p><p>I wanted to create the best Tetris implementation I possibly could though, and best meant the fastest. So I wanted to try all kinds of libraries, engines, and whatnot after initially implementing Tetris. One thing I tried was going down to a lower-level graphics library. It took a whole other month to understand that library, and write my own engine to make Tetris again. But through this exploration, I realized that the field of computer science can go down basically an infinite amount of levels, all the way down to bare metal transistors&mldr;maybe the search for optimization was futile because the more efficient I wanted to make my program the exponentially more amount of time I would have to spend writing at lower levels. During writing I also rewrote my algorithms multiple times, believing that I was upgrading my code, but after a while I realized that I hadn&rsquo;t even benchmarked how fast my previous code ran, so I wasn&rsquo;t even sure if the amount of time I sank into making my code look good was even worth it. Optimization without examination should be regarded with caution.</p><a href=#celebration--reflection><h3 id=celebration--reflection><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Celebration & Reflection</h3></a><p>At the ending month of summer, I felt infinitely more confident in my coding ability than I&rsquo;d ever felt in my entire life. Though, my exploration into depth rather than breadth left me dazed at the sheer amount of ingenuity and innovation in the field itself. Something as simple as creating a simple game of Tetris could be done at a billion different levels of complexity (from graphics APIs to high level game engines). My simple coding of Tetris made me wonder what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I could choose not to understand but make an actual product that people wanted in a short amount of time, such as Tetris, using a very high-level commercial game engine like Unity or Unreal. I could also try to understand how the functions in game engines worked, but it would cost tons of time and the end-user undoubtedly does not care how pretty the code looks. Honestly, I&rsquo;m thoroughly confused and in a deadlock with myself because I can&rsquo;t have my cake and eat it too.</p><a href=#5-redesigning-joyboxs-website><h2 id=5-redesigning-joyboxs-website><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>5.

<em>Logo and icon design</em></p><a href=#investigation-4><h3 id=investigation-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Investigation</h3></a><p>Joybox was a club founded by one of my friends way back in the beginning of 9th grade. The focus of the club was on cancer research, awareness, and funding. I had made a poster for the club previously as a one-time thing, but it wasn&rsquo;t until winter of last year that I noticed that the club had made its own website to provide information on the club, facts about cancer, and methods to donate to fund &lsquo;joyboxes&rsquo;, packages of various things that Joybox sends to children&rsquo;s hospitals for young patients with cancer. I felt that there were various problems with the site of joybox, such as a high maintenance cost (up in the dozens of dollars for the wordpress hosting), janky mobile design, and the lack of a logo and imposing color theme.</p><a href=#goal-4><h4 id=goal-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Goal</h4></a><p>I had experience in school with graphic design 1 and 2, and over the course of junior year as well as junior summer I&rsquo;d been learning web development, familiarizing myself and building minor projects with Svelte, a modern web framework. I figured that I could take on the task of redesigning the website, as well as creating a static site using Svelte to address the problems that I listed above.</p><a href=#preparation-3><h3 id=preparation-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Preparation</h3></a><p>Usually, I would&rsquo;ve been extremely prepared for graphic design, as the graphic design 1 and graphic design 2 classes I took at my school familiarized me with adobe illustrator and photoshop. However, because it was senior year, and I took gd 1 and gd 2 freshman and sophomore year, the licenses that the school offered for the graphic design programs were revoked. Worst yet, adobe changed their free trial period to require a credit card (which I did not think to ask my mother for, thinking that because she wouldn&rsquo;t buy me games there was no reason for her to buy me an electronic application). It was a massive concession to give up and use the open-source inkscape to design the website instead, though it was a choice that I was proud of myself for making at that time.</p><p>Thankfully though, because I was familiar with people in the Joybox club, I was able to get in contact with the president of the club fairly quickly and offer him a redesign. He requested a sample be sent, and sent their current working logo created by a member, so everything was well underway. It made me realize the importance of having connections.</p><a href=#action-3><h3 id=action-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Action</h3></a><p>I realized that working for a real project was much more taxing than working for school projects, or even on a solo project. Not only did I need to make logos, I would also have to design buttons, menus, and style other large swaths of text. Uniformity was always a big concern.</p><p>There were a lot of moments where having a big project and creative authoritive choice felt incredibly good. For example, the color scheme of the old site was orange and blue, which very much encompassed the research part of cancer, but I felt the caring aspect of sending &ldquo;joyboxes&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t represented in that theme, and so chose to use the primary colors (red, blue, yellow) instead, which I felt perfectly expressed the theme.</p><p>However, other times the creative discretion to choose what to do with any design made me feel very anxious. Especially for logo designs: I could never quite pull the trigger on a certain logo or piece of text because there were so many things I could change about the logo. It made me realize the pressure that graphic designers in the real world had to deal with, and made me realize that the infographics that we analyzed in IB Literature may be more random in certain aspects than students give them credit for.</p><p>Learning a whole new editing software for designing this website was a huge challenge. Oftentimes I would get frustrated at the fact that I didn&rsquo;t know how to do a certain thing in inkscape that I didn&rsquo;t know how to do in photoshop. However, pushing past that and recognizing that creativity doesn&rsquo;t come from the tools but instead the person using the tools filled me with reassurance to continue designing the website.</p><p>I also realized that I extremely underestimated the scale of the project. In looking towards the initial website, I first thought that it only contained a few pages of content, but then I realized that the previous web design team at joybox used some archaic methods to embed slideshows into some sections, and there were hyperlinks to pages that I never saw before while designing the website. What I originally thought would take a full weekend took double that time with the extra content I discovered. I was also designing the website around the time when the extended essay, finals, and college applications were due. This underestimation of time made me put the creating the website part of the project on hold, however, I did create the design document for the redesign in full.</p><a href=#celebration-3><h3 id=celebration-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Celebration</h3></a><p>It was reassuring to see club members approve of my redesign, especially the warmer and lighter color schemes and logo. I feel like club members and I gained a deeper understanding of what the club&rsquo;s mission was through our conversation. Hanxun, the official web developer was able to remedy some immediate issues that I had with the site in the redesign, as well as implement some changes to the theme and structuring.</p><a href=#final-reflection-3><h3 id=final-reflection-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Final Reflection</h3></a><p>Although I originally planned to redesign <em>and</em> rewrite the entire website, due to time constraints and slight lack of motivation, I was unable to complete my latter goal. But through this experience, I did learn the importance of taking initiative in bringing about change, conveying ideas, and honestly considering how much time it would take to something.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container></div><div></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Andy Li using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/SpicyRicecaker/quartz>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
