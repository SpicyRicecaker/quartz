## Investigation
Initially, League of Legends was just a game that my sister played when she was in high school that I found to be interesting. I treated it like any other game, a way to relax or have fun after a tough school day.

While in senior year, I wasn't active in some of the more traditional school sports for this senior year, though I began finding that many of the concepts I learned in my IB Sports Science class couuld be applied to my League grind as well. 


Upon closer inspection I began to realize that the game was much deeper and representative of life than I had previously thought: it's like any other sport: there exists athletes, a mindset that the athlete might have, coaches, and a competitive environment. 

### Goal
My number one purpose in this CAS activity was to improve at the game, though many things can be improved. An outcome goal could be reaching an overall higher rank in the game (as the game does have a ranking system), but having a calm mindset and daily routine was also important for me. I initially set a process goal of playing three games every day, not going over or under that limit, and always reflecting upon each and every game that I played. I realized that investigations can come from what you've always loved or enjoyed, but want to gain a deeper insight on. 

## Preparation
I had already the technological hardware to play the game, as I had throughout my life, but because I hadn't been taking the game very seriously for the past few months, I could feel that my mechanical skill was not as good as it used to be. 

I needed to train up my motor skills to help accomplish this task, but was isolated from the games itself. My two friends in this case were the practice tool and loldodgegame online. 

To reflect over things, I used my notebook, with paper and pen, something I had never used in the past before, to craft theories. Finally, to learn new content, I would observe other players in game and in online videos, as well as 

## Action
One thing that I remember had kept me off of the game for a long time was choosing which champions to play. Like track and field, there was so much pomp and circumstance surrounding getting into the game. Time had to be spent selecting champions, choosing champs, and more. Part of the reason why I quit playing was because

League is a 5v5 game, and I was only one player in the game. 9 other players are chosen completely at random. Oftentimes when playing, I'd see my teammates losing and internally blame them. In the past, I would often put blame on my teammates. But from what I learned in IB sports science as well as some coaching videos on the game, I realized that how skilled players were were something *outside my locus of control*. The only things I could control was how well I played myself. In my replays of the game, I stopped watching how well my teammates played and lamented on their own playstyle. I feel like this is one of the single most important lessons I learned from this experience.

One thing that I noticed in my games were that certain games (such as promotional ones, which would determine whether I moved up or down in rank) I would often quiver uncontrollably in excitement, because a win or loss would hold more impact on my rank than usual. The two things that helped me here were thinking about the fact that the games I played were opportunities for improvement, focusing less on the outcome and more on my own performance. I also used techniques from IB Sports Science to calm myself. Progressive muscle relaxation, which involves tensing and relaxing each muscle of the body helped me make my muscles less jittery as I went into games. 

## Celebration
As of may 23, 2022, I've climbed to and am hovering around diamond 2 in rank. Even though this isn't the highest rank that I've climbed to in the past, I'm still glad of the change in mindset that I've had. A positive mindset makes it so much more enjoyable to play the game, and because of what I've learned and applied from sports science, I go into a game much more calmly.

## Final Reflection
This activity made me realize that League, like physical games, contain so many aspects of what we think of as "sports". One can treat it as a way to relax, one can dedicate themselves to improving, or one can watch along and cheer on their favorite professional athlete. The lessons I've learned have helped me deal with failure in other areas of life in a much more positive light. For example, I got a low grade on one of my spanish projects. But instead of lamenting the fact that my teacher grades strictly, or the fact that I also had other projects that took my time, I looked instead at what I could control: the conjugations of the verbs, the phrases and expressions, the mastery of the language itself, and forgave my performance. 

That's not to say however, that my climb in League has always been sunshine and rainbows. On weekends or days without homework, the limit of two to three games that I set for myself often would stretch into a higher number of games, and I questioned whether or not the game bordered on addiction territory. There's so much that I learned from this activity, but it also costed tons of time. A higher rank also made it more difficult to play with my friends: whereas before there was opportunity to play together in ranked, a higher rank makes it impossible. 

# 2. Learning Japanese
Activity
## Investigation
- There's actually a ton of reasons why I wanted to learn Japanese
- Light novel
- Manga
- Songs

Near the end of junior year, I had begun picking up and reading manga as a personal hobby as something to do during quarantine. During that year, I had found a great series called Konosuba that I really enjoyed. The official english translation ended two or three volumes behind the japanese one, so I wanted to learn Japanese so that I could read Konosuba. I had also found an interest in reading manga (Japanese comic books), however, many series that had fan translations were very badly translated, with some groups using google translate to do their translations. I figured if the translations were barely legible english, it'd be worth it to try to learn japanese myself. During quarantine, with the long time spent doing homework and in front of the computer, I began to enjoy listening to music as a remedy for monotony. An artist and a band that I really enjoyed were Aimer and Yorushika (ヨルシカ). The melodies and chords in their songs were incredibly captivating, and because I listened to many of their songs on repeat, I wondered if I would be able to understand them well should I be able to learn Japanese.
### Goal
My goal for this activity was to better understand the Japanese language. I really wanted to be able to read a light novel, but I knew that for a book that was well above grade level, in a language that I had no experience in (except for some of the kanji characters, which carried over from Chinese), that was a bit ambitious. I wanted to learn from manga, but that was also difficult because text couldn't be easily copied from manga (and thus look up). <!--So I settled for learning a single song.-->
## Preparation
Preparation for this activity was quite frankly, simple and straightforward at the very beginning, then descended to utter hell. 

At first I was considering going straight into the lyrics and trying to understand a song that way, since I did know the chinese characters, however after taking one look at the japanese lyrics for sukidakara (好きだから) by Yuika, I realized that it was going to be very hard to do, perhaps even impossible. There were specific uniquely japanese characters like katakana and hiragana as well as kanji that I didn't understand at the time. Much less the structure of the lexicon, I also had no idea how grammar in the language worked. 

For learning languages, there exist an innumerable number of tutorials and guides and regimens. I picked an article by Tofugu to start learning the very basics of the language, but as I'll discuss later, going back to the drawing board and rethinking of a plan to learn the language was one of the biggest temptations that I struggled with through learning the language.

## Action

Learning the initial alphabet of the language, hiragana and katakana were the very easiest steps. I realized the importance of mneumonics in memorizing information, and by the end of a few hours of dedication and practice, I could reasonably recognize and sound out all the basic characters. The problem was what came next. 

I needed some way to understand the grammar of the language, aside from the basic characters. I decided to pick up a textbook. But Tae Kim, the de facto textbook that online forums recommendeded was hundreds of pages long. I was prepared to go through with reading it, but after a few days, it became a huge drag for me to read through it. The author used kanji that I wasn't famililar with in example sentences, and for every single concept there were dozens of rules and exceptions.

- So I tried another textbook. This one recommended to ignore the things that you didn't understand.
- I read through all 50 chapters of the textbook in the span of a week. Every word I read into my head, but at face value I understood maybe 15% of the text.
- It was a weird feeling... usually if something is right outside of my comfort zone, it'd still feel like a difficult thing to due, and would strain my brain. Like learning a concept in math for example. But reading the 50 chapters in such a flurry and glossing over things I didn't understand felt so absurd that I developed kind of a numbness to it. I began to feel jaded about learning the language, and by the latter chapters I was just hoping to finish the textbook. 

Then I tried to read through a single chapter in a manga. I understood 10% of the words (mostly from the fact that I knew Chinese) and maybe 1% of the grammar. Looking back, although I had a lot of time that summer, that drive easily led me to burnout, and I almost considered quitting learning the language. 

- It really made me feel depressed. Learning a language wasn't like doing homework: I couldn't tell myself that I'd finish the homework today and forget it tomorrow: I realized that learning a language was something that took daily effort and discipline: the discipline to challenge yourself but also pace yourself to tackle things only just above your level. 
- There's also no such thing as procrastination, and doing homework at the last minute. If I procrastinated on Japanese, I would just never learn the language. 
- My theory, conjecture really, is that language is sort of like learning math. Before one learns calculus they need to know algebra, and before algebra the basic operations of adding, subtracting, and so on. 

- I found a youtuber named Cure Dolly who explained things in a very logical way. 

- Learning the language through songs was also very fun. The lyrics are shorter in length than something like manga or a book, so I'm able to read it without over stressing it, if that makes sense.
- There's some sentences I get, some sentences that I don't get, but songs I never get unless I try and memorize them. There's that beautiful moment when something unintuitive becomes intuitive. And repeating the same verse of a song over and over again in my head allowed me to understand some sentences.

## Celebration
I'm still unable to understand most of manga, books, or anime that I watch. However, I have learned a song and a half and expanded my vocabulary, and my understanding of the grammar is much better than it used to be.
## Final Reflection
Learning Japanese was very hard, and it was a journey that I would have never thought I would've tackled in the past. It made me realize the difference between pursuing a school subject and personal skill.

## Investigation
Joybox was a club founded by one of my friends way back in the beginning of 9th grade. The focus of the club was on cancer research, awareness, and funding. I had made a poster for the club previously as a one-time thing, but it wasn't until winter of last year that I noticed that the club had made its own website to provide information on the club, facts about cancer, and methods to donate to fund 'joyboxes', packages of various things that Joybox sends to children's hospitals for young patients with cancer. I felt that there were various problems with the site of joybox, such as a high maintenance cost (up in the dozens of dollars for the wordpress hosting), janky mobile design, and the lack of a logo and imposing color theme. 
### Goal
I had experience in school with graphic design 1 and 2, and over the course of junior year as well as junior summer I'd been learning web development, familiarizing myself and building minor projects with Svelte, a modern web framework. I figured that I could take on the task of redesigning the website, as well as creating a static site using Svelte to address the problems that I listed above. 
## Preparation
Usually, I would've been extremely prepared for graphic design, as the graphic design 1 and graphic design 2 classes I took at my school familiarized me with adobe illustrator and photoshop. However, because it was senior year, and I took gd 1 and gd 2 freshman and sophomore year, the licenses that the school offered for the graphic design programs were revoked. Worst yet, adobe changed their free trial period to require a credit card (which I did not think to ask my mother for, thinking that because she wouldn't buy me games there was no reason for her to buy me an electronic application). It was a massive concession to give up and use the open-source inkscape to design the website instead, though it was a choice that I was proud of myself for making at that time.

Thankfully though, because I was familiar with people in the Joybox club, I was able to get in contact with the president of the club fairly quickly and offer him a redesign. He requested a sample be sent, and sent their current working logo created by a member, so everything was well underway. It made me realize the importance of having connections.
## Action
I realized that working for a real project was much more taxing than working for school projects, or even on a solo project. Not only did I need to make logos, I would also have to design buttons, menus, and style other large swaths of text. Uniformity was always a big concern. 

There were a lot of moments where having a big project and creative authoritive choice felt incredibly good. For example, the color scheme of the old site was orange and blue, which very much encompassed the research part of cancer, but I felt the caring aspect of sending "joyboxes" wasn't represented in that theme, and so chose to use the primary colors (red, blue, yellow) instead, which I felt perfectly expressed the theme.

However, other times the creative discretion to choose what to do with any design made me feel very anxious. Especially for logo designs: I could never quite pull the trigger on a certain logo or piece of text because there were so many things I could change about the logo. It made me realize the pressure that graphic designers in the real world had to deal with, and made me realize that the infographics that we analyzed in IB Literature may be more random in certain aspects than students give them credit for. 

Learning a whole new editing software for designing this website was a huge challenge. Oftentimes I would get frustrated at the fact that I didn't know how to do a certain thing in inkscape that I didn't know how to do in photoshop. However, pushing past that and recognizing that creativity doesn't come from the tools but instead the person using the tools filled me with reassurance to continue designing the website. 

I also realized that I extremely underestimated the scale of the project. In looking towards the initial website, I first thought that it only contained a few pages of content, but then I realized that the previous web design team at joybox used some archaic methods to embed slideshows into some sections, and there were hyperlinks to pages that I never saw before while designing the website. What I originally thought would take a full weekend took double that time with the extra content I discovered. I was also designing the website around the time when the extended essay, finals, and college applications were due. This underestimation of time made me put the creating the website part of the project on hold, however, I did create the design document for the redesign in full.
## Celebration
It was reassuring to see club members approve of my redesign, especially the warmer and lighter color schemes and logo. I feel like club members and I gained a deeper understanding of what the club's mission was through our conversation. Hanxun, the official web developer was able to remedy some immediate issues that I had with the site in the redesign, as well as implement some changes to the theme and structuring. 
## Final Reflection
Although I originally planned to redesign *and* rewrite the entire website, due to time constraints and slight lack of motivation, I was unable to complete my latter goal. But through this experience, I did learn the importance of taking initiative in bringing about change, conveying ideas, and honestly considering how much time it would take to something.
